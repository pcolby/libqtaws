 *
 *  AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to exchange data in the cloud. You can use the AWS
 *  Data Exchange APIs to create, update, manage, and access file-based data set in the AWS Cloud.</p><p>As a subscriber,
 *  you can view and access the data sets that you have an entitlement to through a subscription. You can use the APIS to
 *  download or copy your entitled data sets to Amazon S3 for use across a variety of AWS analytics and machine learning
 *  services.</p><p>As a provider, you can create and manage your data sets that you would like to publish to a product.
 *  Being able to package and provide your data sets into products requires a few steps to determine eligibility. For more
 *  information, visit the AWS Data Exchange User Guide.</p><p>A data set is a collection of data that can be changed or
 *  updated over time. Data sets can be updated using revisions, which represent a new version or incremental change to a
 *  data set. A revision contains one or more assets. An asset in AWS Data Exchange is a piece of data that can be stored as
 *  an Amazon S3 object. The asset can be a structured data file, an image file, or some other data file. Jobs are
 *  asynchronous import or export operations used to create or copy
