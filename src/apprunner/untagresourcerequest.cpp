 *  <fullname>AWS App Runner</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an

 * 
 *  resources>
 * 
 *  App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery
 *  pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability, and
 * 
 *  security>
